# time-tracker
 A python project to track my time


The Timer.py program will write out a csv file of each active window entry. If a csv exists for the current day then it will append to the existing file. 

The generate_sum.py program will produce a bar plot of the most visited windows per day and also write out a .txt file with i) total PC time and ii) most visited.
